# CoffeeSales-Data_Analysis

## Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of coffee sales data using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to clean, organize, and analyze the dataset to identify key trends and insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and regional distribution. The final outcome includes a comprehensive and interactive dashboard summarizing all findings.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The initial dataset was processed to ensure accuracy and consistency before analysis. The following steps were performed:
	•	Removed duplicate records and verified data consistency.
	•	Filled missing values using Excel functions such as VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH.
	•	Formatted the dataset into structured Excel Tables for better data management.
	•	Standardized date and numerical formats to ensure uniformity across all records.

## Data Analysis
The cleaned dataset was analyzed using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to extract meaningful insights. The analysis covered the following areas:
	•	Identification of the top five customers based on total sales.
	•	Evaluation of sales by country to assess regional performance.
	•	Examination of total sales by time, including monthly and yearly breakdowns to identify trends and seasonality.

Interactive tools such as Slicers and Timelines were integrated to enable dynamic filtering and deeper exploration of the data.

## Dashboard Design
An interactive Excel dashboard was created to present the analytical results in a structured and visually clear manner. The dashboard includes:
	•	Key performance indicators (KPIs) summarizing major findings.
	•	Pivot charts illustrating customer, regional, and temporal sales performance.
	•	Interactive slicers and timelines to allow users to explore the data efficiently.
	•	A professional layout designed for readability and insight communication.
